The Python we have been using so far was defined in the Python Primer or in S1 Python programmming courses.  
In this class we review some of these features (with new examples) and then introduce a few extra
code features needed to understand the ICA.  The Blast code used in the ICA is
written using the basic features of Python introduced in the Python Primer, just with
a few extra extensions added along the way.  So here we review where we have got
so far with Python before extending to include these new features.  Of course, your
Python skills may extend beyond that set of skills from the Python Primer.  But
that's fine as long as the ICA code makes sense!!

if print1() and print2():

#Thats OK but the second function is not called if the first are true
#So we stop evaluation (moving left to right) when the first condition is true
#Since the functions print1 and print2 both return true print2 is never called
#How can we call both print1() and print2() but not print("Finished...")
#just by changing the operator

def functioneg(var1,var3=6,var12=7):
    print("My example: ",var1 + var3 + var12)
functioneg(1,2,3)
functioneg(3)

#Use default parameter to extend functions to add new parameters at the end of the parameter list
#This means that old calls to the function still work!

#Write a function that prints something passed to the function, but fails gracefully when the function is called
#without passing a string.

#Q13 A new Python print function variant - uses f-strings or formatted string

#Q15
#You'll notice in the code that sometimes I use os.linesep as a newline character

#Do you think this makes sense to do this if you want code to run on multiple platforms?
# Yes - containerise to fix?
