To carry out a motif analysis you will take each DNA fragment (which are sequenced without errors
and composed of just AGCT bases) and scan along the sequence (use a scanning window) to convert
each sequence to a set of oligonucleotides (k-mers) 8bp in length.

• How many 8bp oligonucleotides can be identified in each 200bp purified fragment?
N - kmer size +1
200 - 8 + 1 = 193

• If you compare two 200b sequences and compare all oligonucleotides from one sequence to
the other, how many oligonucleotide comparisons need to be made?
193*193 = 37249

• If you compare 100, 200bp sequences to each other how many oligonucleotide comparisons
need to be made?
193 oligonucleotides 
100 seqs 

(193*193)*100*100 = 372,490,000


• If you compare 100, 200bp fragment sequences from the ChIP-seq data to the 100, 200bp
sequences from the control data, how many comparisons need to be made?
10,000 comparisons

• How will this performance scale is you have more sequences, and what is the likely Order-Of
performance of this simple approach???
O(N^2)
